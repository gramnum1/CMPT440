Correctness:

- The program produces incorrect output. The program does this:
$ java driverDFA gncgwnnnnnng
>java driverDFA gncgwng
That is a solution
>java driverDFA gncwgng
That is not a solution.


Style:

- Correct indentation

- Poor block comments

- Both files have a header different from the guidelines. Remember: Each file
  must have a block comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the
  student's name, the assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about
  what is contained in the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.
